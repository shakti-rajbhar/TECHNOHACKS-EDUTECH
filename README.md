Welcome to the Technohacks Edutech Data Analytics Internship repository! In this internship, I have dived into data analytics, where I worked on various projects ranging from data cleaning to data visualization. Let's explore this internship.

## Tools

For the tasks in this internship, we primarily use **Python**, a versatile programming language known for its data analysis capabilities. Here's how Python is used in this internship:

- **Data Cleaning**: Python is used to clean and preprocess the data, which includes handling null values and outliers.
- **Summary Statistics**: Python calculates summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Data Distribution**: Python is used to see the data distribution of the dataset by using histogram/bar charts.
- **Duplicate Values**: Python is also used to deal with duplicate values in the dataset.

### Task 1: Data Cleaning
In this task,I perform data cleaning, focusing on removing null values and outliers. The key libraries used for this task are:
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical operations.
- **IO**: For handling input and output.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for data visualization.

### Task 2: Summary Statistics
For this task, the goal is to calculate essential summary statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation. The primary libraries used in this task are:
- **Pandas**: Again, we rely on Pandas for data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For mathematical operations.

### Task 3: Visualization using Histogram
For this task,  data distribution using histogram/bar charts in the dataset. The key libraries used for this task are:
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **IO**: For handling input and output.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for data visualization.


### Task 5: Remove Duplicates
For this task, the goal was to identify and remove duplicate values in the dataset. The key libraries used for this task are:
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **IO**: For handling input and output.

  
## Key Insights

Throughout the internship, you'll encounter some key insights, including:
- **Dealing with Null Values**: learned how to handle 10% of null values in the dataset, which can be done by either removing columns or rows or replacing them with the median.
- **Handling Outliers**: As part of the process,  addressed 15 outliers in the dataset, improving data quality.
