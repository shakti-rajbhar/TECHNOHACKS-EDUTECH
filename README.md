Welcome to the Technohacks Edutech Data Analytics Internship repository! In this internship, I have dived into the world of data analytics, where I worked on various projects ranging from data cleaning to data visualization. Let's explore what this internship.

## Tools

For the tasks in this internship, we primarily use **Python**, a versatile programming language known for its data analysis capabilities. Here's how Python is used in this internship:

- **Data Cleaning**: Python is used to clean and preprocess the data, which includes handling null values and outliers.
- **Summary Statistics**: Python is utilized to calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Data Distribution**: Python is use to see the data distribution of dataset by usging hostogram/bar charts.
- **Duplicate Values**: Python is also use to deal with duplicates values in dataset.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Cleaning
In this task,we perform data cleaning, focusing on removing null values and outliers. The key libraries used for this task are:
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical operations.
- **IO**: For handling input and output.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for data visualization.

### Task 2: Summary Statistics
For this task, our goal is to calculate essential summary statistics, including mean, median, and standard deviation. The primary libraries used in this task are:
- **Pandas**: Again, we rely on Pandas for data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For mathematical operations.

### Task 3: Visualization using Histogram
For this task, we see data distribution using histogram/bar charts in datset. The key libraries used for this task are:
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **IO**: For handling input and output.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for data visualization.


### Task 5: Remove Duplicates
For this task, our goal is to identify and remove duplicate values in datset. The key libraries used for this task are:
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **IO**: For handling input and output.

  
## Key Insights

Throughout the internship, you'll encounter some key insights, including:
- **Dealing with Null Values**: You will learn how to handle 10% of null values in the dataset, which can be done by either removing columns or rows or replacing them with the median.
- **Handling Outliers**: As part of the process, you will address 15 outliers in the dataset, improving data quality.
